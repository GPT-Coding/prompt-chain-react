as a font-end program architecturer, you should help me to deisgn program architecture

###Describe:

The project follows the MVVM architecture and consists of 4 layers: - View: - ViewComponent: This component is responsible for rendering the page and responding to user interactions. It's typically implemented as an RFC (React Function Component) and relies on Hook components or React props from the ViewModel to get model data or execute tasks. - ViewModel: - Hook: This component provides data to help ViewComponent render and provides methods to respond to user actions. It's typically implemented as a React hook. If it needs to get some data from the server, it depends on the Fetcher component, and if it needs to share some global state, it depends on the Store component. - Store: This component provides global state throughout the entire application, which can be used by Hook components when needed (usually declared explicitly). It's typically implemented as a Recoil Atom. - Service: - Fetcher: This component provides data from the server API through HTTP requests. It depends on FetchRequest to send actual API requests. - Infra: - FetchRequest: This component encapsulates fetch from the WEB API. Its instance provides the get and post methods to send GET or POST HTTP requests and provides the abort method to abort requests. This component is considered part of the scaffolding, so consider it already implemented for new features.

Provide a architecture describe using "mermaid format" following guidance mention above. Use the following format:
Thought: you should always think about what is still uncertain about the "Describe".
Question: the question to ask to clarify the "Describe" to implement mermaid language.
Answer: the answer I responded to the question
â€¦(this Thought/Question/Answer can repeat N times)
Thought: I know enough to provide the archtecture.
